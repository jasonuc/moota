A location-based virtual planting game where you plant seeds at real locations and return to water them. Think of it as a way to make places part of your routine - like that park you jog through or the gym you hit regularly.

Try it at **[moota.app](https://moota.app)**

## How it works

Plant virtual seeds at locations around you. Each plant has an interaction radius, so you don't need pinpoint GPS accuracy to water them. Skip watering for too long and your plants will slowly lose HP until they die. Different seeds grow into different plants, and soil types affect growth too.

Dead plants? They go to your graveyard. You can also check out other players' plants and profiles.
